# ![](./docs/fairpy_logo.png) FairPy: A Python Library for Machine Learning Fairness

FairPy is a comprehensive python library for **machine learning fairness**, covering various fairness **notions**, multiple advanced fair **algorithms**, and corresponding experimental **datasets**.
FairPy served as a good toolkit for mitigating bias and helping to deliver equitable outcomes from machine learning models.

Reach AI Fairness with few lines of codes:
```python
from fairpy.dataset import Adult
from fairpy.model import LabelBias

dataset = Adult()
split_data = dataset.split()
model = LabelBias()
model.fit(split_data.X_train, split_data.y_train, split_data.s_train)
model.predict(split_data.X_test)
```

## Installation

To install FairPy via **pip**, run the command:

    pip install fairpy

### Optional Dependencies

There are some optional dependencies beyond a regular installation. These dependencies are only used for some specific algorithms. 
You can install them manually in need and fit them to your local environment.

 - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): used for all **deep learning models**
 - [gurobipy](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.5/quickstart_linux/cs_using_pip_to_install_gr.html): commercial optimization software, used for **InflFair**

## Algorithms

We implement the following algorithms in FairPy. Algorithms are divided into three types: **pre-processing**, **in-processing**, and **post-processing**.

| Type | Name in FairPy | Task           | Year | Ref. |
